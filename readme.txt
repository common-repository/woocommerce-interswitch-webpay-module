Requires at least: 3.0

== Description ==

The WooCommerce Interswitch WebPay Module plugin allows you to use the Interswitch WebPay Nigerian gateway with your WooCommerce online store. It will add the Nigerian currency and provide settings for the Interswitch gateway within the WooCommerce gateway settings.

Note: Interswitch is an account based payment gateway for Nigeria. To use this plugin you need to have both WooCommerce installed and activated and an account with Interswitch WebPay. Note that interswitch (at the time of writing) charge $500 for an account. There are other gateways available and I am working on integrating one or two at the moment for other Nigerian clients. Please get in touch for more information.
